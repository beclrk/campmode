# Commit After Changes

After making any code or config changes in this project, **always commit them** in the same session.

- Run `git add` for the changed files (or `git add .` when appropriate).
- Run `git commit` with a short, clear message describing what changed.
- Do **not** push unless the user asks to push or the task explicitly required deploying/pushing (e.g. "push to GitHub").
- Use `required_permissions: ["git_write"]` or `["all"]` as needed for git commands.

If the user said they don't want commits, or asked to only make changes without committing, skip the commit.
