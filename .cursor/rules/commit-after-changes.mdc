# Auto Commit and Push After Changes

**Do this automatically every time you make code or config changes.** Do not wait for the user to ask. We work quickly; the user should not have to remind you to push.

1. After editing files: run `git add` for the changed files (or `git add .` when appropriate).
2. Run `git commit -m "short clear message"` describing what changed.
3. Run `git push` (or `git push origin main`) so changes appear on GitHub and Vercel immediately.
4. **Use `required_permissions: ["all"]` for push.** Without it, push fails with "could not read Username" and changes stay local.

Only skip commit/push if the user explicitly said they don't want commits or pushes, or asked to only make changes without committing.
