# Commit and Push After Changes

After making any code or config changes in this project, **commit and push** in the same session so the user can view changes on GitHub (and Vercel) straight away.

- Run `git add` for the changed files (or `git add .` when appropriate).
- Run `git commit` with a short, clear message describing what changed.
- **Then run `git push origin main`** so changes appear on GitHub immediately.
- Use `required_permissions: ["git_write", "network"]` or `["all"]` for commit + push.

If the user said they don't want commits/pushes, or asked to only make changes without committing, skip the commit and push.
