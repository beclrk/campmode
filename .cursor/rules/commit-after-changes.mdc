# Commit and Push After Changes

After making any code or config changes in this project, **commit and push** in the same session so the user can view changes on GitHub (and Vercel) straight away.

- Run `git add` for the changed files (or `git add .` when appropriate).
- Run `git commit` with a short, clear message describing what changed.
- **Then run `git push origin main`** so changes appear on GitHub (and Vercel) immediately.
- **Always use `required_permissions: ["all"]` for both commit and push.** The sandbox blocks access to the macOS Keychain; without `all`, `git push` fails with "could not read Username" and changes stay local.

If the user said they don't want commits/pushes, or asked to only make changes without committing, skip the commit and push.
