# Auto Commit and Push After Every Change

**Always do this automatically.** After any code or config change, commit and push without being asked. Do not wait for the user to say "push" or "commit" – do it in the same response as the edit. We work quickly; the user should not have to remind you.

1. After editing files: `git add` the changed files (or `git add .` when appropriate).
2. `git commit -m "Short clear message"` describing what changed.
3. **Immediately** run `git push origin main` so changes are on GitHub and Vercel redeploys.
4. **Critical**: When running `git push`, always pass **`required_permissions: ["all"]`** in the tool call. Without this, GitHub auth fails in the environment and the push does not happen.

Skip only if the user explicitly said not to commit/push or to only make changes without committing.
